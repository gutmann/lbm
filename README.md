This repository contains test code for a lattice boltzmann simulation.  Currently it permits the user to specify a topographic profile (profile.nc) which will be read in and used as a no-slip bottom boundary condition.  The various features of the outer wind field are currently hard coded. 

The primary initial focus is for underestanding wind redistribution of snow in complex terrain, though it has many potential applications.
